# characterguess
Password guesser...
These two programs are examples that can be used with the ACARA "Classroom ideas - Privacy and Security" if teachers want to use a general purpose code like Python to illustrate the password generator / guesser similar to the Scratch programs in the document. 
Note - there are many ways to create these programs in Python, some much more elegant or 'pythonish' than the examples given.
Another note - these codes are not endorsed by ACARA nor created by that great organisation.
